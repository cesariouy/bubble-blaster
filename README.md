# Bubble Blaster

A lone bubble... shooting bubble bullets... at bubble targets...

Welcome to Bubble Blaster, my take on Atari's classic <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asteroids_(video_game)" target="_blank">Asteroids</a> game. You play as Bub, a blue bubble whose objective is to fly around and destroy all of the moving targets in as short a time as possible. Use your arrow keys for movement and the spacebar to fire. Hit enter at any time to restart. This game was written using JavaScript and an unhealthy dose of trigonometry.
